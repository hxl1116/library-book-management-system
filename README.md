Tasked with the responsibility to design and implement the Library Book Management System (LBMS). The LBMS is Book Worm Library's (BWL) system for providing book information to users, tracking library visitor statistics for a library statistics report, tracking checked out books, and allowing the library inventory to be updated. It is the server-side system that provides an API used by client-side interfaces that BWL employees use.
